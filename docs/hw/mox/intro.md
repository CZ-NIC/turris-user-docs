The Turris MOX is a unique modular router suitable for small and medium
enterprises, geeks and the households of all users who are aware of the
internet’s risks. Thanks to its secure default configuration, automatic
firmware updates and adaptive distributed firewall, the product is very secure.
The Turris MOX is also open source – it runs a free Linux operating system
(based on OpenWrt).

## What to buy

If you want something ready to go, you can buy a Turris MOX as a complete set.
[Pocket Wi-Fi](sets/pocketwifi.md) and [Power Wi-Fi](sets/powerwifi.md) are for
completely wireless solution but configuration is a little bit trickier due to
only one Ethernet port. The easiest to configure and the most common
configuration is [Classic](sets/classic.md). That one contains both Wi-Fi and
Ethernet ports and thus is much easier to configure.

For more advance use-cases, you might want to build your own MOX. For that you
will need the basic set [MOX Start](sets/start.md), decide what you need and pick
from the list of modules and add-ons how to extend it.
