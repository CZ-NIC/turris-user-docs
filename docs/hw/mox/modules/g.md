# MOX G (Super Extension)

## Key features

MOX G allows you to add more hardware to your configuration. It contains a
mPCIe slot for a compatible Wi-Fi card, disk controller or LTE modem. If you
choose to install an LTE modem, the MOX G features a SIM card slot that you can
use.

If you use Wi-Fi networks, we recommend using the original MOX [Wi-Fi add-on
(mPCIe)](../addons.md#wi-fi-mpcie) which can deliver significantly higher
speeds than SDIO Wi-Fi.

## Specification

* 1× SIM card slot

* 2 years warranty
* Size: 100 mm × 58 mm × 14 mm (without case)

* Humidity: 10% to 90% RH, Non-condensing

## Compatibility

MOX G has the same features as [MOX B](b.md) and additionally a
pass-through PCIe bus, which means that it can be used together with
[MOX B](b.md) or [MOX F](f.md).

This module can be used **only as an extension in a set**. You will need at
least [MOX Start](../sets/start.md). If you’re combining it with other
modules, make sure they are compatible. You can verify the order of modules and
pass-through of PCIe and SGMII signals in the configurator on
<https://mox-configurator.turris.cz>.
