# Preparation of microSD card for Turris MOX

If your Turris MOX A is connected to the Internet, you can insert the microSD
card into it and choose [rescue mode number 6](/hw-spec/mox/mox_rescue_modes/)
when starting the router. Turris MOX will download the latest image from the
Internet, create a partition if there is not, format your microSD card to the
Btrfs filesystem to be able to use snapshots. They can be useful when you plan
to make major changes to the system. See schnapps, which is a tool for managing
snapshots.

If you don't like the previous option - flashing from the cloud, you can
download the [image](https://repo.turris.cz/hbs/medkit/) and save it to your
microSD card or any USB drive. There is no need to extract it and make sure
that the external storage has partition and it should be formatted to Btrfs to
enjoy its advantages - snapshots. You can also use any other file system like
EXT4 and use [rescue mode number 4](/hw-spec/mox/mox_rescue_modes/), which
boots from the microSD card or USB drive.
