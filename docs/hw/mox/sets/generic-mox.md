The Turris MOX is a unique modular router suitable for small and medium
enterprises, geeks and the households of all users who are aware of the
internet’s risks. Thanks to its secure default configuration, automatic
firmware updates and adaptive distributed firewall, the product is very secure.
The Turris MOX is also open source – it runs a free Linux operating system
(based on OpenWrt) on open hardware.

You can buy a Turris MOX as a complete set ([Pocket Wi-Fi](pocketwifi.md),
[Power Wi-Fi](powerwifi.md) and [Classic](classic.md)) or build your own.
For that you will need the basic set [MOX Start](start.md)
which you can expand with one or more modules (MOX [B](../modules/b.md),
[C](../modules/c.md), [D](../modules/d.md), [E](../modules/e.md),
[F](../modules/f.md) and [G](../modules/g.md)) and
add-ons ([MOX Wi-Fi add-on (SDIO)](../addons.md#wi-fi-sdio),
[MOX Wi-Fi add-on (mPCIe)](../addons.md#wi-fi-mpcie) and
[MOX PoE](../addons.md#poe) add-on).
