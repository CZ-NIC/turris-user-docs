## About

{! hw/mox/sets/generic_mox.md !}

This set consists of [MOX A (Basic)](../modules/a.md), a power source and a
microSD card, representing the basic building block of the modular solution
Turris MOX. It can also be used as a small server. If you add the MOX Wi-Fi
add-on (SDIO), the result is a Wi-Fi router with Bluetooth support.

The MOX Start set is just the beginning. But there are many reasons to fall in
