Choose the MOX Classic if you want both wireless connectivity and the option to
connect several devices by Ethernet cable.

source, a microSD card, the [MOX B (Extension) module](../modules/b.md), [MOX C
(Ethernet) module](../modules/c.md), [MOX Wi-Fi add-on
(SDIO)](../addons.md#wi-fi-sdio) and [MOX Wi-Fi add-on
