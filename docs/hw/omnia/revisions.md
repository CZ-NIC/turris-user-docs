# Turris Omnia revisions

Turris Omnia router received during its manufacturing and public sale various
small or even bigger changes. This is list of revisions and notes on those
changes from users perspective.

To find the exact revision of Turris Omnia you can look on markings on PCB. In
front of board on right side just behind LEDs there is code `CZ11NIC**`.


## CZ11NIC13

This is first publicly available revision of Turris Omnia. It was sent to backers
from Indiegogo campaign and was also first batch available in retail stores.

Routers from the campaign were provided to users in chassis of various colors and
possibly even without chassis all together as board only. In retail shops only
available version was with black chassis.

Omnias were available with or without Wi-Fi and in configuration with 1GB and 2GB
memory.


## CZ11NIC20

This was first revamp of Turris Omnia. The primary change was that instead of two
RAM chips there were four chips used on the board to achieve the same capacity of
RAM.

Omnia routers were manufactured in this revision only in configuration with Wi-Fi
and with 2GB of RAM.

!!!warning
    Some of the routers in this revision are missing GPIO ports as they were
    temporarily dropped because of problems getting required parts.

As a minor but user noticeable change this revision introduced blue buttons
instead of black ones.


## CZ11NIC23

Marked as Omnia 2019 and Omnia 2020 in retails.

This is second revamp of Turris Omnia board.

The users most notable change is color change of chassis. Previous black color was
switched to metallic silver. It also comes preinstalled with Turris OS 4.X
while previous versions were starting from 3.X version and had to upgrade to
4.X first.

This revision is manufactured only with Wi-Fi and with 2GB of RAM same as
CZ11NIC20. It also may feature blue buttons instead of black ones in several
batches.
