It is impossible for Turris team to ensure compatibility with every piece of
hardware available on the market. But what we can do is provide a place where
our users can exchange their experience. That is the goal of hardware
compatibility list.

You can find our [hardware compatibility list](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl)

* [Other devices](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/other)

When contributing, always use the most specific category. For example for USB
