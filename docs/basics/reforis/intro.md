# reForis

## What is reForis

ReForis is the new router administration interface used on [Turris devices](../models.md). It allows to simply set up a router according to user requirements in both home and enterprise network. As a part of the interface there is also initial setup wizard which helps users to make an initial configuration step by step.

## Advantages of using reForis

ReForis offers an easy device administration which is meant to be simple even for inexperienced users. Doing a configuration from reForis is fully supported and undergoes heavy internal testing. With focus on simplicity, there might be a corner cases where you might need to use [LuCI](../luci/luci.md), but in general, those two should not clash.

Using reForis is simple, intuitive and fully responsive. After initial setup a router is ready and no further settings are required. Current state of a device with all important information is represented on the single [overview page](screenshots/reforis.md#router-overview).

ReForis also contains the notifications which ensure that users donâ€™t miss any important event about their routers.

This simplified interface offers the variety of other features in form of separate plugins which can be optionally installed.

## Previous version Foris

At this time, the previous version of the interface called Foris still exists. It offers some features not implemented in reForis yet. However, the new version provides features which have not been ever included in Foris. In the future, Foris is going to be completely replaced by reForis.

## Technologies

It is powered by tiny layer of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
and most of the functionality is done via [React](https://reactjs.org/) using
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a base for styling.

The interface is modular, supporting various plugins that can be installed over
the time by user to broaden the possibilities of what they ca do with their
router. You can find sources of the reForis base as well as it's modules in our
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.nic.cz/turris/reforis).
