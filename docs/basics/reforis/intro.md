# reForis

The latest and the most user-friendly interface for Turris routers is called
reForis. It is reimplementation and redesign of the old Foris interface
featuring latest technologies while still keeping the same focus - trying to
make router management as easy and as intuitive as possible.

## Technologies

It is powered by tiny layer of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
and most of the functionality is done via [React](https://reactjs.org/) using
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a base for styling.

The interface is modular, supporting various plugins that can be installed over
the time by user to broaden the possibilities of what they ca do with their
router. You can find sources of the reForis base as well as it's modules in our
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.nic.cz/turris/reforis).

If you want to see more of reForis and what can you set up, take a look at
