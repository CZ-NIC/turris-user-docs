OpenVPN server on Turris
========================

Starting with Turris OS 3.6, you can configure OpenVPN easily through the Foris web interface.

What is OpenVPN
---------------

[OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) is an open technology for
[virtual private networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network). It works on the client-server
principle - multiple clients connect to an OpenVPN server to get access to a regularly inaccessible network.
For example, you can access computers in your home or office LAN from your laptop connected to any Internet connection.

The access is [authenticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) (only permitted clients can connect to
the server) and [encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) (nobody can read
the communication between the client and the server). Additionaly, your Internet traffic can be routed via
the OpenVPN connection (this is useful e.g. if your company's servers may be accessed only from the company's LAN).

!!! important
    You can use your Turris as an OpenVPN server only if it is accessible from the Internet (it has a public IP address
    or at least the OpenVPN port is forwarded to it).

How to set up OpenVPN in Foris
-------------------------------

This manual describes how to set up OpenVPN in **a few easy steps** using Foris:

### 1. Download the OpenVPN package

Log into the Foris user interface and go to the **Updater** tab. Check the box next to **OpenVPN**.
Then press **Save changes**.

### 2. Check that the package was installed

Go to the **Notifications** tab and refresh the browser, you should see all the installed packages and the
"foris-openvpn-plugin" among them.

### 3. Reboot your router using Foris

Go to the **Maintenance** tab, scroll down and press **Reboot**.

### 4. Generate certification authority

Once the router has rebooted, refresh the page and log back in. There should now be a new **OpenVPN** tab (usually
under the **Updater** tab). Go to that tab and click **Generate CA**.

![No certification authority](no-ca.png)

It might take up to 30 minutes to generate the certificate authority, but this isn't a process that we can speed up
in any way. Afterwards you can just click **Reload page**.

### 5. Enable configuration

![Configuration disabled](conf-disabled.png)

By checking the box **Configuration enabled** you let the plugin create a simplified VPN configuration.
If you have already had your configuration (from your use of OpenVPN in the past) it is filled into the form.
Otherwise the plugin creates a default configuration for you. After you click **Apply configuration**,
you can temporarily lose connection to your router, you just need to refresh the page or wait a moment.

![Configuration enabled](conf-enabled.png)

In most cases you donâ€™t need to change any of the settings. There are these configuration parameters:

* **Listen on IPv6** - Uncheck only if your IPv6 connection is broken.
* **Protocol** - Change only if your ISP limits UDP transmission (this practice is defective by nature but some
ISPs even do so).
* **OpenVPN network** - The default address range is almost always suitable. In very rare cases, your LAN or your
ISP can use these addresses. Then the network address and the netmask has to be changed to the address not used
in the network.
* **All traffic through vpn** - Check only if you want all your traffic to the Internet to be routed over your VPN.
For example, you need to connect to your servers which can be accessed only from the address of your router.
* **Use DNS from vpn** - Check only if you need to use the DNS on your router. For example, your router is connected to
a community network which has private servers and their domain names are not propagated to the public Internet.

*Please note: if something is not working as it should or you would like to extend the OpenVPN configuration,
[please write your suggestions here](https://forum.turris.cz/t/openvpn-server-easy-and-fast/3674).*

### 6. Client configuration

For each client you need to generate a separate file, which the user will load into his OpenVPN client. Here you can
just add the name of the client (this serves as a note to yourself). Write the name of the client into
the **Client name** field and press the **Create** button.

![Client configuration](client.png)

The configuration file is generated within a few minutes. This again is an encryption process, which cannot be sped up.
Reload the current page to see whether this process has been finished.

Once the file is generated it can be downloaded using the **Get Config** button. Unwanted clients can be removed
by pressing the **Revoke** button. This drops the client's permission to connect to the OpenVPN server.

![Client configuration download](client-download.png)

The **Router address** field must be filled if your router has only a private WAN address but is accessible via
a public address (a 1:1 NAT is used or the OpenVPN port is forwarded through the NAT). *This must be set before you
download the client configuration files.*

Setting up OpenVPN on the client side
-------------------------------------

At this point you need to select and download a client for your platform, if you don't already have one. The OpenVPN
client is available for all possible platforms, you just need to find a manual for yours to set it up correctly.
