Why enable Data Collection
=========================

One of the initial motives that led to the development of the Turris router was
to set up a secure home router that is capable of responding to current threats
in almost real time. However a large amount of data is needed to identify an
attacker and distinguish it from the usual traffic.

The data collection system (Sentinel) is a key source of such a data. We use this
data to build
and distribute a dynamic firewall which afterwards helps to keep your router secure.
Enabling data collection thus helps to protect your own router (and home) as well
as to protect the rest of the world.
