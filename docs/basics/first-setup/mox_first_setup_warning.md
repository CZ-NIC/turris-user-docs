If you didn't buy a complete set or if you bought some extension modules, make
sure everything is connected and put together before starting your MOX for the
first time and **before connecting it to the power supply**. Make sure to
connect all desired MOX modules in a correct order. Commonly used setups are
ABC, AB and AF. We recommend to check the correct combination of modules and
their interoperability in our [MOX
configurator](https://mox-configurator.turris.cz/).
    
!!! warning
    Shut down your device and disconnect it from the power supply before
    connecting or disconnecting modules and/or upgrades. The hardware
    configuration of the device can not be changed at runtime.
