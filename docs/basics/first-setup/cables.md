    Make sure you use proper Gigabit Ethernet cables, i.e.,
    [Cat 5e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable) or
    [Cat 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_6_cable) straight unshielded
    twisted pair cables with 8 wires (8P8C) to connect your devices to the
    Turris as well as your Turris to the modem or another ISP device.
