Preparation of microSD card for Turris MOX
==========================================

If your MOX A is connected to the internet you can insert your microSD card into the microSD slot on the main board of module A and choose [rescue mode number 6](/hw-spec/mox/mox_rescue_modes/) when staring the MOX. MOX will download the image from the internet and use it.


If you don't like the previous option, you can just download the [image](https://repo.turris.cz/hbs/medkit/) and save it to your microSD card or any USB drive and use [rescue mode number 4](/hw-spec/mox/mox_rescue_modes/).
