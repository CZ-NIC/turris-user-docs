# Documentation for Turris routers

The documentation is written in English. It will walk through you with the first setup of your router, give you insights of features available in Turris OS. It will guide you through the administration interface Foris.
Show you some services and a few cases, which might come handy. Tell you more why there is opt-in data collection, why do we do that. Help you with troubleshooting and error reporting.

For formatting, we are using Markdown language.
